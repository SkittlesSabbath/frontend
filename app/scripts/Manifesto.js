    <h3>
      1. The gap between the physical world and the digital world is closing.
    </h3>

    <p>
      In the early days of the internet, there was a gap between IRL and online.
      We went by our handles. If you spent time with internet people, you were
      weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Times have changed. Now we live our lives on the internet. Social media
      has real name policies. We date internet strangers. The "digital world"
      and the "physical world" have merged. Now they're just the world.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Digital ownership is just as real as physical ownership.</h3>

    <p>
      Digital ownership didn't make much sense when anything could be copied.
      Media companies tried and failed to stop copying with DRM and spyware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blockchains changed all that. They make digital ownership real, even
      without a licensing agreement.
    </p>

    <h3>
      3. Digital ownership should give at least the same rights as physical
      ownership... maybe more.
    </h3>

    <p>
      As a baseline, digital ownership should give us the same rights we have
      over physical things. We should be able to have it, keep it, share it, or
      destroy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digital ownership could even unlock new kinds of rights that wouldn't make
      sense for physical ownership. Digital ownership should make room for these
      new kinds of rights whenever possible.
